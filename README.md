# :robot: 3.5.0 - Modifying Resistance

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

We will work with differing levels of resistance in this lab.  Both series and parallel resistor circuts will be constructed in order to understand how resisotrs function within an electrical system. 🚀

## Circuit Setup

Import the file in this repository titled, "sample_circuits.txt" into the Circuit Simulator App.  These are not closed.  Add the approprate grounds to all three of the circuits to make them work (the first circuit needs two grounds).  Now build these circuits on your breadboard as practice.
